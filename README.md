# Module 6 Challenge: Weather Dashboard

Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I have created a page that will allow users to search by city to find current and future forecasted weather data.  After users have searched for a city by name, the name will pop up in the search history in the form of a button, which users can click on again to bring up current weather data.  This page uses Bootstrap's grid system to format different parts of the page.

This page makes use of the OneCall Weather API, which has undergone recent changes so that it does not actually provide all needed data.  Thanks to a tutor and multiple TA's, I was still able to make use of the data that OneCall offers to meet the requirements of this assignment.

There appears to be an issue with the accuracy of the UV index data, and in the future I would like to find more accurate data to fill this field on the page so that it can be more helpful to a potential user.  I would also like to rework the data available for the 5-day forecast to be more representative of true high temperatures for each upcoming day.

The deployed page can be found here: https://catherinecunningham.github.io/mod-6-weatherdashboard/
